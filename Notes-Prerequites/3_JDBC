3️⃣ JDBC (Conceptual Understanding Only)

JDBC = Java talking to database.

Without Spring, this is how Java talks to DB:

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, pass);
PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users");
ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();

while(rs.next()) {
    System.out.println(rs.getString("name"));
}

Problems:
	•	Too much boilerplate
	•	Manual connection handling
	•	Manual closing

Spring simplifies this.

But understand the flow:

Java → SQL Query → Database → ResultSet → Java Objects

That’s enough.
