🔥 IMPORTANT

Do NOT delay Spring course trying to master prerequisites.

Learn them as needed.

Example:

When course shows:

@Repository

Pause → Google → Understand → Continue.

That’s efficient learning.

1️⃣ THREADS (Basic Understanding Only)

🔹 What is a Thread?

A thread = a unit of execution.

Think like this:

If 100 users call your API at same time,
Spring server creates 100 threads to handle them.

You don’t manually create threads in Spring normally.

Just understand:
	•	One request = one thread (usually)
	•	Threads allow multiple users at same time

Basic Example :

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println("Hello from " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        };

        Thread t = new Thread(task);
        t.start();
    }
}

That’s enough.

You don’t need deep multithreading now.
