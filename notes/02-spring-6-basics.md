spring.io -> you will get to learn so many things about spring framwork and springBoot

So we will start from spring framework and then move towards SpringBoot.

If you want to see official documentation about spring search -> spring docs and visit -> spring framework documentation.

Prerequites -> Core java concepts. like: 

1. Java syntax.
2. OOPS concept.
3. Exception handling
4. Threads (not that imp but basic are imp.)
5. Collection API
6. Knowledge on JDBC (java database connectivity) because when you are working with JDBC you are working with data and for data you need to know the database connectivity. And for that you need to know JDBC.
7. Spring project you need to know build tool -> which is Maven and Gradle. (For this learning we are going to work on MAVEN).
8. We are also going to work with spring ORM and for that we need to know Hibernate or ORM knowledge is imp.
